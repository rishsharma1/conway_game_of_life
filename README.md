It is pretty interesting how simple rules can give rise to complexity. RIP Conway.

# Rules for game of life:

* For a cell that is 'populated':
    * Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude. 
    * Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation. 
    * Each cell with two or three neighbors survives. 
* For a space that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated'
    * Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
